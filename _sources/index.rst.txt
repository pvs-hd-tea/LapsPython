Extension of LAPS [#]_ to synthesize Python and R programs
----------------------------------------------------------

Developed within the scope of the advanced software practical **AI Methods and Tools for Programming** offered by the `Parallel and Distributed Systems Group <https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/>`_ at the Institute of Computer Science at Heidelberg University under supervision by Prof. Dr. Artur Andrzejak.

Credits of package **dreamcoder** go to the contributors of `https://github.com/ellisk42/ec <https://github.com/ellisk42/ec/tree/icml_2021_supplement>`_. Changes made to this package:

#. dreamcoder/translation.py: decrease memory allocation from 64 GB to 4 GB (line 341)
#. dreamcoder/domains/re2/re2Primitives.py: fix exception handling in lines 47, 68
#. Added the following files with translations of Python primitives to R:

   * dreamcoder/domains/list/listPrimitives.R
   
   * dreamcoder/domains/re2/re2Primitives.R
   
   * dreamcoder/domains/text/textPrimitives.R
  
Please note that the LapsPython repository only contains the dreamcoder files necessary to run the LapsPython functionality. Compiled OCaml solvers and Moses, which are required to run LAPS itself, are not provided.
